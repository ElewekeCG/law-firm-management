# law-firm-management
This system was designed as part of my MSc project to enable law firms effectively manage their clients and cases
Google cloud speech-to-text API was integrated to allow legal practitioners keep record of their court proceedings without typing for long hours.
This project was developed with Laravel, MySQL, JavaScript, and bootstrap.
The project can run on XAMPP or Laragon.
